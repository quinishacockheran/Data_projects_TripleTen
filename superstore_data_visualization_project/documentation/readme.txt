README: Superstore Data Visualization Project
-----------------

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is a comprehensive data visualization analysis of a Superstore dataset using Tableau Public. As a consultant hired to rescue a struggling superstore, I examined various aspects of the business—ranging from profit and loss centers to advertising opportunities and product return rates—to develop actionable insights that could help steer the company toward profitability.

Project Components:
-------------------
1. **Data Files:**
   - **Superstore.xls:** This file contains multiple datasets used in the analysis, including orders, returns, and related business metrics.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - **Part 1: Profits & Losses**
     - Identify the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers among various dimension pairs (e.g., subcategory + region, shipping mode + product ID).  
     - Determine which products should be discontinued.  
     - Recommend three product subcategories to focus on and three to stop selling.
   - **Part 2: Advertising**
     - Identify the top 3 combinations of states and months with the highest average profit per unit sold.  
     - Visualize the average profit for each month for these states and argue a justified advertising spend based on the return on ad spend ratio (using 1/5 of profits as the threshold).
   - **Part 3: Returned Items**
     - Analyze return rates by transforming the Returns field into a calculated field (null values as 0 and "Yes" as 1).  
     - Visualize which products and which customers have the highest return rates.  
     - Create a separate visualization comparing average profit against average return rate on a chosen dimension (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type) to support strategic decisions.
   - **Part 4: Documentation & Submission**
     - This README and accompanying files serve as the project documentation.
     - Visualizations are published on Tableau Public, and screenshots are provided as needed.

3. **Tableau Public Dashboard:**
   - The interactive dashboard has been published on Tableau Public.

4. **Data Visualization Rubric:**
   - The rubric provided by TripleTen for the project's approval.

Methodology:
------------
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Imported the Superstore dataset (`Superstore.xls`) into Tableau.
   - Performed necessary data cleaning and created calculated fields, including a transformation of the Returns field (null to 0, "Yes" to 1).
   - Prepared the data for multi-dimensional analysis of profits, losses, and returns.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Explored various dimension pairs to identify key profit and loss centers.
   - Evaluated advertising potential by analyzing geographic and temporal trends in average profit per unit.
   - Investigated abnormal return rates to highlight products and customer segments that may be negatively impacting profitability.
   - Developed a series of visualizations that justify conclusions with clear, data-driven insights.

Key Insights & Recommendations:
-------------------------------
- Specific dimension pairs reveal significant profit and loss concentrations, guiding where to focus improvement efforts.
- Targeted advertising in select states and months shows promising potential based on the average profit per unit.
- Certain products and customer segments exhibit abnormal return rates, suggesting areas for product discontinuation or further operational review.

How to View the Project:
-----------------------------
- **Tableau Public Dashboard:**
  1. Click the link above to open the interactive dashboard.
  2. Navigate through the dashboard to explore detailed visualizations and insights.
- **Project Files:**
  - All project files are included in this ZIP archive, except for the Tableau workbook file, which is accessed via the provided Tableau Public link due to size restrictions.

Future Improvements:
--------------------
- Incorporate additional visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, drill-down analyses) for more granular insights.
- Integrate further geographic and temporal dimensions to refine the advertising strategy.
- Enhance calculated fields for a deeper analysis of return rates and operational efficiency.
