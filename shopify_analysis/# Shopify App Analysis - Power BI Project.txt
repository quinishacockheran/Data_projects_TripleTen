# Shopify App Analysis - Power BI Project

This Power BI project analyzes data from the Shopify App Store to uncover key factors that drive the success of Shopify apps. Using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites, this project explores app performance, user reviews, developer responsiveness, and app categories through interactive visualizations and insightful metrics.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**
- Understand the landscape of Shopify apps.
- Identify trends in user reviews and app ratings.
- Analyze developer responsiveness and its impact on app success.
- Create compelling visualizations that tell a clear story with data.

**Tools Used:**
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Excel (`shopify.xlsx` dataset)

**Dataset:**
The `shopify.xlsx` file contains four tables:
- `apps`: Details of apps on the Shopify App Store (e.g., app name, developer, review count, average rating)
- `apps_categories`: Join table connecting apps to their categories
- `categories`: App categories
- `reviews`: User reviews including ratings, helpfulness, and developer responses
